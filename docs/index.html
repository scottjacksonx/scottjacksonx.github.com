		<h1>NoteTote Documentation / Support</h1>
		<h2>The Rules</h2>
		<p>Every <em>x</em> minutes (ten by default), NoteTote will search your Simplenote account for a note starting with the phrase &ldquo;NoteTote_Downloads&rdquo; &mdash; this is your download note.</p>
		<p>NoteTote goes through the download note, treats every line as a URL, and tries to download the file that's located at the URL.</p>
		<p><em>Please</em> try to make sure that only one note starts with &ldquo;NoteTote_Downloads&rdquo; &mdash; if multiple notes start with it, the most-recently-modified note will be used.</p>
		<p><b>Super-secret tip:</b> any line in your download note that starts with &ldquo;#&rdquo; is considered a comment and will be left alone when NoteTote checks for new downloads. As a result, you can use <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/453204090/q-trick">Merlin&rsquo;s neat &ldquo;q&rdquo; trick</a> for easy access to your download note. Boo-yah, or whatever.</p>
